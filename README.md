# Disclaimer !

Please note, that "FullScreen Mode" hijack the variable used by the In Game available Fps counter (yes there is one).
So if you're using it, or anything related to it (PerfOverlay.DisplayMethod, PerfOverlay.FpsDraw, etc),
you might want to save your modifications before using this software as it will reset those settings to default values.
If you have no idea what this speech is all about, then don't worry, you're not concerned.
